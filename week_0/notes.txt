Anatomy of a webpage
-HTML and CSS are not programming languages-- markup language, for writing stuff down
-HTML = bones --> creates structure
-CSS = skin + physical features
-Javascript = muscles

-HTML: imagine website is made of boxes within boxes..etc
-Tags: <tagname>…</tagname>
	whatever is inside the tag follows certain rules of that tag
	you can also nest tags: imagine w/in tag1, you have tag2
		<tag1>
			<tag2>
				Your content
			</tag2>
		</tag1>
-Tags are rules + also create their own boxes
-General tag = div
	<div> Content </div>
-Zen coding plug-in helps with writing html

-<head> </head> nothing in the head ever shows up on the webpage body
	where you define metadata (data about data)
	i.e. where you define the title that shows up on the tab
-Always put "<!DOCTYPE html> at the start of any page to be supported in all browsers
-Boxes, inputs, links and images: main four types of elements

<input type="text">
	input tag
	type is an attribute
	text = the attribute's value
	this specific example creates a blank box for inputting text

different between checkbox and radio button (checkbox you can select multiple, radio buttons --> can only select one)

don't have to close input tags b/c there's nothing you can really put into input tags (the user puts the info in) --> you can put placeholder text though

Image tag needs a source
Link tag uses "a href…"
target="_blank" makes a link open in a new window

<h1> (biggest) to <h6> (smallest)

Concept of the Internet as a line (not a cloud)
World is a big neighborhood
Internet is the road between the houses
Client = you and your browser
Server = machine sending data
	look at web address, if says localhost: it's located on your computer
Everyone has an address: IP Address (internet protocol)

In Terminal, you can use command "ping"
	ping google.com shows you how fast it responds to you

Google Chrome is a web browser = client
Google itself is a server

CSS
Cascading style: whatever comes last in code will show, EXCEPT class takes precedence over tags
